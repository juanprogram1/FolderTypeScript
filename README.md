Hi, This is my first project with package.json, i'm very happy, let's go!

This is an ESM node package intended to be a boilerplate to work with ES modules and Typescript. It works with eslint, prettier and husky.

Just clone the repository, go into frontend-typescript and execute npm i. Then you can use all the commands described in the "script": section of the package.json file.

In you want to contribute please make a fork and submit a pull-request.
